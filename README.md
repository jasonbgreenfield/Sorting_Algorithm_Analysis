# Sorting_Algorithm_Analysis

Implemented three sorting algorithms (bubbleSort, insertionSort, and mergeSort) and unit tested each for edge cases. Runs empirical asymptotic runtime for each algorithm and plots results.
Inspired by class project from Algorithms (Amherst College, Fall 2018) but expanded to include unit testing which is not part of the Amherst curriculum and implemented in Python.

to run python3 unit_tester.py and python3 plotting.py
